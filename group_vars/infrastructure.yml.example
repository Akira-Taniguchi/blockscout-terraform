terraform_location: "/usr/local/bin/terraform"

## Name of the DynamoDB table where current lease of TF state file will be stored
dynamodb_table: "poa-terraform-lock"

## If ec2_ssh_key_content is empty all the virtual machines will be created with ec2_ssh_key_name key. Otherwise, playbooks will upload ec2_ssh_key_content with the name of ec2_ssh_key_name and launch virtual machines with that key
ec2_ssh_key_name: "sokol-test"
ec2_ssh_key_content: ""

## EC2 Instance will have the following size:
instance_type: "m5.large"

## VPC containing Blockscout resources will be created as following:
vpc_cidr: "10.0.0.0/16"
public_subnet_cidr: "10.0.0.0/24"
# This variable should be interpreted as following:
# Variable: 10.0.1.0/16 
# Real networks: 10.0.1+{{ number of chain starting with 0 }}.0/24
db_subnet_cidr: "10.0.1.0/16"

dns_zone_name: "poa.internal"

## Size of the EC2 instance EBS root volume
root_block_size: 120

# DB related variables

## This value represents the name of the DB that will be created/attached. Must be unique. Will be prefixed with `prefix` variable.
chain_db_id:
  core: "core"
  sokol: "sokol"

## Each network should have it's own DB. This variable maps chain to DB name. Should not be messed with db_id variable, which represents the RDS instance ID.
chain_db_name:
  core: "core"
  sokol: "sokol"

## The following variables describes the DB configurations for each network including usernames, password, instance class, etc.
chain_db_username:
  core: "core"
  sokol: "sokol"

chain_db_password:
  core: "fkowfjpoi309021"
  sokol: "kopsdOPpa9213K"
 
chain_db_instance_class:

  core: "200"
  sokol: "100"

## Type of disk to be used for the DB.
chain_db_storage_type:
  core: "io1"
  sokol: "gp2"

## This should be set only if chain_db_storage is set to io1
#chain_db_iops:
#  core: "1000"
#  sokol: "1500"

## Blockscout uses Postgres as the DB engine. This variable describes the Postgres version used in each particular chain.
chain_db_version:
